**WooTah** is a mobile application that allows users to track their daily water drinking habit.

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can add their water intake using either the given suggestions or typing in their own amount
- [x] User can set daily water drinking goal
- [x] User can exit the app without losing data
- [x] User can reset the amount of water consumed daily
- [x] User can see recommendations on how much more water they should drink to meet their goal

**Future** enhancements:

- Data visualization of user's monthly water drinking pattern
- Alarms to remind users to drink water throughout the day
- Allow users to share their achievements with friends and families through social media platforms
- Allow users to take a picture of their daily tumbler/water container to generate a better, more accurate estimate of their regular amount of water intake

## Notes

While building WooTah, we ran into a variety of technical problems that involve debugging and testing (NullPointerException, anticipating and parsing user input, etc.).
